title: Get to know Basic Controllers
---

Basic Controllers are the last layer of the FlashServer library. 
They are used to create the endpoints for the API. <br />
In the BasicController, you will find the CRUD endpoints for the models.


## Create a BasicController
Here you will learn the concepts of creating a BasicController for the ManipulationManager. <br />
there are 2 ways to create a BasicController:
- write it yourself with the help of the library
- use the FlashServer CLI to create it for you by your models and manipulation managers

### Manually Create a BasicController
To create a Controller you need to create a class that inherits from the `BasicController` class. <br />
Here is an example of a Controller class:
```csharp
[Route("api/[controller]")]
[ApiController]
public class ModelController : BasicController<InModel, OutModel, Model>
    public ModelController(ModelMM dataManager, ILogger<ModelController> logger) : base(dataManager, logger)
    { }
}
```

### Use the FlashServer CLI
For the CLI you can... 
```shell
flashserver endpoint create <ModelName>
```
