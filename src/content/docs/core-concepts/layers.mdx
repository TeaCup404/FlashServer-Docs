title: The Layers
---

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

In FlashServer you have 3 layers:
- **Data Layer**
- **Manipulation Layer**
- **Presentation Layer**

## Data Layer
Data Layer is the first layer of the FlashServer library.
It is used to interact with the database. <br />
In the Data Layer, you will find the basic CRUD functions and frequently used functions for the models.

The Data Layer has the following components:
- **Context**: The class that is used to connect to the database.
- **Models**: The folder that contains all your models.

### Context
In the Data Layer the you have a wrapper class for the regular DbContext class called BaseContext.
which helps in automatic date updating for the models.
<Aside>Only if you are using the library [BaseEntity](#baseentity) class you should use the BaseContext class</Aside>

Here is an example of a Context class:
```csharp
public class Context : BaseContext
{
    public Context(DbContextOptions<Context> options) : base(options) { }

    public DbSet<Model> Models { get; set; }
}
```

### Data Managers
#### BaseTable
The BaseTable class is the class that is used to interact with the tables inside the database,
This class needs to be extended by the developer for more personalized functions but still gives you the basic 
functions that are common.

Here is an example of a BaseTable class:
```csharp
public partial class ModelDM : BaseTable<Model, Context> {}
```

#### BaseView
The BaseView class is the class that is used to interact with the views inside the database,
This class needs to be extended by the developer for more personalized functions but still gives you the basic
functions that are common.

Here is an example of a BaseView class:
```csharp
public partial class ModelDM : BaseView<Model, Context> {}
```


### Interfaces
The Data Layer has 2 interfaces that are used to validate the incoming and outgoing data from the client.
- **IIn**: The interface that is used to validate the incoming data from the client.
- **IOut**: The interface that is used to validate the outgoing data to the client.

<Aside>The best way to implement the interfaces are on the default class</Aside>

Here is an example of a InModel class:
```csharp
public class InModel : IIn
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string Description { get; set; }
}
```

Here is an example of a OutModel class:
```csharp
public class OutModel : IOut
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string Description { get; set; }
}
```

### BaseEntity
BaseEntity is a base class for the data models, it's propose is to added `UpdatedDate` and `CreatedDate` to the modals
for easy tracking


## Manipulation Layer
Manipulation Layer is the middle layer between the controllers and the data managers.
It is used to manipulate the data before it is sent to the data manager or before it is sent to the controllers. <br />
Manipulation Managers are wrapping the Data Managers function and manipulating the data between the layers.

### Manipulation Manager
In the Manipulation Layer, you will find the Manipulation Manager class.
This class is used to manipulate the data before it is sent to the data manager or before it is sent to the controllers.
The Manipulation Manager as the basic CRUD functions and frequently used functions for the models, and a manipulation function
that takes the default data model for the manager or a generic model and return the corresponding data model
<Aside type="caution">Notice that if you are using a generic model it should be in the corresponding profile as a map</Aside>

## Presentation Layer
Presentation Layer is the last layer of the FlashServer library.
It is used to create the endpoints for the API. <br />
In the Presentation Layer, you will find the CRUD endpoints for the models.

### Basic Controller
In the Presentation Layer, you will find the Basic Controller class.
This class is used to create the endpoints for the API. <br />
The BasicController uses the manipulation manager as a service for getting the data from the database.
