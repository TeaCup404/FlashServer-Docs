## Data Managers
Data Managers are the first layer of the FlashServer library.
They are used to interact with the database. <br />
In the Data Manager, you will find the basic CRUD functions and frequently used functions for the models:
- Get by primary key
- Get all
- Create 
- Update
- Delete

### Adding a function
To add a function to the Data Manager you need to create a function in the Data Manager class that extends the `BaseTable` class. <br />
Here is an example of a function in the Data Manager class:
```csharp
public class ModelDM : BaseTable<Model, Context>
{
    public async Task<Model> GetByName(string name)
    {
        return await _context.Models.FirstOrDefaultAsync(x => x.Name == name);
    }
}
```

### Override the basic functions
To override the basic functions you need to create a function in the Data Manager class that extends the `BaseTable` class. <br />
Here is an example of a function in the Data Manager class:
```csharp
public class ModelDM : BaseTable<Model, Context>
{
    public override Model GetByID(int id)
    {
        id = GetSpecialKey(id);
        return _context.Models.FirstOrDefault(x => x.Id == id);
    }
}
```



## Manipulation Managers
Manipulation Managers are the middle layer between the controllers and the data managers.
They are used to manipulate the data before it is sent to the data manager or before it is sent to the
controllers. <br />
Manipulation Managers are wrapping the Data Managers function and manipulating the data between the layers

### Adding a function
To add a function to the Manipulation Manager you need to create a function in the Manipulation Manager class that extends the `ManipulationManager` class. <br />
Here is an example of a function in the Manipulation Manager class:
```csharp
public class ModelMM : ManipulationManager<InModel, OutModel, Model, Context>
{
    public OutModel GetByName(string name)
    { 
        using(var context = _contextFactory.CreateDbContext())
        {
            Model data = _baseTable.GetByName(ID, context);

            return TransformFromData(data);
        }
    }
}
```

### Override the basic functions
To override the basic functions you need to create a function in the Manipulation Manager class that extends the `ManipulationManager` class. <br />
Here is an example of a function  in the Manipulation Manager class:
```csharp
public class ModelMM : ManipulationManager<InModel, OutModel, Model, Context>
{
    public override OutModel GetByID(int id)
    {
        OutModel outModel = base.GetByID(id);
        
        outModel.Name = "Special Name";

        return outModel;
    }
}
```

### Adding new Data Manager
Adding a new Data Manager to to manipulation manager is easy, you just need to create a new instance of the Data Manager and pass it to the base class. <br />
Here is an example of a function in the Manipulation Manager class:
```csharp
public class ModelMM : ManipulationManager<InModel, OutModel, Model, Context>
{
    public static ModelDM _dataManager = new ModelDM();
    public static NewModelDM _newDataManager = new NewModelDM(); ## New Data Manager
    public ModelMM(IDbContextFactory<Context> contextFactory, IMapper mapper) : base(contextFactory, _dataManager, mapper)
    {}
}
```
